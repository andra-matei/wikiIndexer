'''Java''' ([[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]: Jawa; [[Javanese language|Javanese]]: ꦗꦮ; [[Sundanese language|Sundanese]]: ᮏᮝ) is an [[island]] of [[Indonesia]].  With a population of over 141 million (the island itself) or 145 million (the administrative region) {{As of|2015|lc=y}} Census released in December 2015,&lt;ref name=&quot;citypopulation.de&quot;&gt;[http://citypopulation.de/Indonesia-MU.html Indonesia: Urban Population of Cities] Retrieved 22 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Java is home to 56.7 percent of the [[Demographics of Indonesia|Indonesian population]] and is the [[List of islands by population|most populous island]] on [[Earth]]. The [[Indonesia]]n capital city, [[Jakarta]], is located on [[West Java|western Java]]. Much of Indonesian history took place on Java. It was the center of powerful Hindu-Buddhist empires, the Islamic sultanates, and the core of the colonial [[Dutch East Indies]]. Java was also the center of the [[History of Indonesia|Indonesian struggle for independence]] during the 1930s and 1940s. Java dominates [[Indonesia]] politically, economically and culturally.

Formed mostly as the result of volcanic eruptions, Java is the [[List of islands by area|13th largest island]] in the world and the [[List of islands of Indonesia|fifth largest]] in [[Indonesia]]. A chain of volcanic mountains forms an east–west spine along the island. Three main languages are spoken on the island: [[Javanese language|Javanese]], [[Sundanese language|Sundanese]], and [[Madurese language|Madurese]].  Of these, Javanese is the dominant; it is the native language of about 60 million people in Indonesia, most of whom live on Java. Furthermore, most residents are [[bilingual]], speaking Indonesian (the official language of Indonesia) as their first or second language. While the majority of the people of Java are Muslim, Java has a diverse mixture of religious beliefs, ethnicities, and cultures.

Java is divided into four provinces, [[West Java]], [[Central Java]], [[East Java]], and [[Banten]], and two special regions, [[Jakarta]] and [[Yogyakarta (special region)|Yogyakarta]].

==Etymology==
The origins of the name &quot;Java&quot; are not clear. One possibility is that the island was named after the [[Foxtail millet|''jáwa-wut'']] plant, which was said to be common in the island during the time, and that prior to Indianization the island had different names.&lt;ref&gt;Raffles, Thomas E.: ''[[The History of Java (1817 book)|History of Java]]''. Oxford University Press, 1965, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; There are other possible sources: the word ''jaú'' and its variations mean &quot;beyond&quot; or &quot;distant&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Raffles, Thomas E. 1965. Page 3&quot;&gt;Raffles, Thomas E.: ''[[The History of Java (1817 book)|History of Java]]''. Oxford University Press, 1965, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; And, in [[Sanskrit]] ''yava'' means barley, a plant for which the island was famous.&lt;ref name=&quot;Raffles, Thomas E. 1965. Page 3&quot;/&gt; &quot;Yawadvipa&quot; is mentioned in [[India]]'s earliest epic, the [[Ramayana]]. [[Sugriva]], the chief of [[Rama]]'s army dispatched his men to Yawadvipa, the island of Java, in search of [[Sita]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9ic4BjWFmNIC&amp;pg=PA465 History of Ancient India Kapur, Kamlesh]&lt;/ref&gt; It was hence referred to in India by the Sanskrit name &quot;yāvaka dvīpa&quot; (dvīpa = island). Java is mentioned in the ancient Tamil text ''[[Manimekalai]]'' by [[Chithalai Chathanar]] that states that Java had a kingdom with a capital called Nagapuram.&lt;ref&gt;Hindu culture in ancient India by Sekharipuram Vaidyanatha Viswanatha, p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tamil Literature by M. S. Purnalingam Pillai, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Tamils Eighteen Hundred Years Ago by V. Kanakasabhai, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Another source states that the &quot;Java&quot; word is derived from a [[Proto-Austronesian language|Proto-Austronesian]] root word, ''Iawa'' that meaning &quot;home&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hatley, R., Schiller, J., Lucas, A., Martin-Schiller, B., (1984). &quot;Mapping cultural regions of Java&quot; in: Other Javas away from the kraton. pp. 1–32.&lt;/ref&gt; The great island of Iabadiu or Jabadiu was mentioned in [[Ptolemy|Ptolemy's]] ''[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geographia]]'' composed around 150 CE [[Roman Empire]]. ''Iabadiu'' is said to means &quot;barley island&quot;, to be rich in gold, and have a silver town called Argyra at the west end. The name indicate Java,&lt;ref name =&quot;AncientGeo&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=History of Ancient Geography|author=J. Oliver Thomson|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2013|isbn=9781107689923|url =https://books.google.co.id/books?id=GpP0wKQ1lksC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|pages=316–317}}&lt;/ref&gt; and seems to be derived from Hindu name Java-dvipa (Yawadvipa).

==Geography==
[[File:Mount Bromo (2012).JPG|left|thumb|249x249px|[[Mount Bromo]] in [[East Java]]]]
{{See also|Volcanoes of Java}}
Java lies between [[Sumatra]] to the west and [[Bali]] to the east. [[Borneo]] lies to the north and [[Christmas Island]] is to the south. It is the [[list of islands by area|world's 13th largest island]]. Java is surrounded by the [[Java Sea]] to the north, [[Sunda Strait]] to the west, the [[Indian Ocean]] to the south and [[Bali Strait]] and [[Madura Strait]] in the east.

Java is almost entirely of [[volcano|volcanic]] origin; it contains thirty-eight [[mountains]] forming an east–west spine that have at one time or another been active [[volcano]]es. The highest volcano in Java is Mount [[Semeru]] (3,676 m). The most active volcano in Java and also in Indonesia is [[Mount Merapi]] (2,930 m).

More mountains and highlands help to split the interior into a series of relatively isolated regions suitable for [[Paddy field|wet-rice]] cultivation; the rice lands of Java are among the richest in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;RICKLEFS_p15&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Ricklefs|first=M. C.|title=A History of Modern Indonesia since c.1300|edition=2|publisher=MacMillan|year=1990|location=London|page=15|isbn=0-333-57690-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Java was the first place where [[Indonesian coffee]] was grown, starting in 1699. Today, [[Coffea arabica]] is grown on the Ijen Plateau by small-holders and larger plantations.

The area of Java is approximately 150,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;MONK_7&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Monk, |first=K. A.|author2=Fretes, Y.|author3=Reksodiharjo-Lilley, G.|title=The Ecology of Nusa Tenggara and Maluku |publisher=Periplus Editions Ltd.|year=1996|page=7|location=Hong Kong|isbn=962-593-076-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is about {{convert|1000|km|abbr=on}} long and up to {{convert|210|km|abbr=on}} wide. The island's longest [[river]] is the 600&amp;nbsp;km long [[Solo River (Java)|Solo River]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jasatirta1.go.id/english/3WorkArea/20BengawanSolo.htm Management of Bengawan Solo River Area] Jasa Tirta I Corporation 2004. Retrieved 26 July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The river rises from its source in central Java at the [[Mount Lawu|Lawu]] volcano, then flows north and eastward to its mouth in the [[Java Sea]] near the city of [[Surabaya]]. Other major rivers are [[Brantas]], [[Citarum]], [[Manuk River|Cimanuk]] and [[Serayu River|Serayu]].

The average temperature ranges from 22&amp;nbsp;°C to 29&amp;nbsp;°C; average humidity is 75%. The northern coastal plains are normally hotter, averaging 34&amp;nbsp;°C during the day in the [[dry season]]. The south coast is generally cooler than the north, and highland areas inland are even cooler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Climate, Weather, and Temperature of Java Indonesia|url=http://www.javaindonesia.org/general/climate-weather-temperature-java-indonesia/|accessdate=1 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[wet season]] begins in November and ends in April. During that rain falls mostly in the afternoons and intermittently during other parts of the year. The wettest months are January and February.

West Java is wetter than East Java and mountainous regions receive much higher rainfall. The [[Parahyangan]] highlands of West Java receive over 4,000&amp;nbsp;mm annually, while the north coast of East Java receives 900&amp;nbsp;mm annually.

==Natural environment==
[[File:Tanjung Gelam - Karimunjawa.jpg|left|thumb|Tanjung Gelam, a beach in [[Karimunjawa National Park|Karimunjawa]]]]
The [[natural environment]] of Java is [[tropical rainforest]], with ecosystems ranging from coastal [[mangrove]] forests on the north coast, rocky coastal cliffs on the southern coast, and low-lying tropical forests to high altitude rainforests on the slopes of mountainous volcanic regions in the interior. The Javan environment and climate gradually alters from west to east; from wet and humid dense rainforest in western parts, to a dry [[savanna]] environment in the east, corresponding to the climate and rainfall in these regions.[[File:Java-1934 -2.jpg|thumb|Male [[Javan rhinoceros|Javan rhino]] shot in 1934 in West Java. Today only small numbers of Javan rhino survive in [[Ujung Kulon National Park|Ujung Kulon]]; it is the world's rarest rhino.]]Originally Javan wildlife supported a rich biodiversity, where numbers of [[endemic]] species of flora and fauna flourished; such as the [[Javan rhinoceros]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edgeofexistence.org/mammals/species_info.php?id=11 |title=Javan Rhinoceros (Rhinoceros sondaicus) |author= |work= |publisher=EDGE Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered |accessdate=26 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Banteng|Javan banteng]], [[Javan warty pig]], [[Nisaetus bartelsi|Javan hawk-eagle]], [[Pavo muticus|Javan peafowl]], [[Silvery gibbon|Javan silvery gibbon]], [[Javan lutung]], [[Java mouse-deer]], [[Javan rusa]], and [[Javan leopard]]. With over 450 species of birds and 37 endemic species, Java is a birdwatcher's paradise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wildlifenews.co.uk/2011/indonesia-bird-watching-tour-with-wildlife-news-travel/ |title=Indonesia bird watching tour |author= |work= |publisher=wildlifenews.co.uk |accessdate=26 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are about 130 freshwater fish species in Java.&lt;ref&gt;Nguyen, T. T. T., and S. S. De Silva (2006). ''Freshwater finfish biodiversity and conservation: an asian perspective.'' Biodiversity &amp; Conservation 15(11): 3543-3568.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since ancient times, people have opened the rainforest, altered the ecosystem, shaped the landscapes and created [[rice paddy]] and terraces to support the growing population. Javan rice terraces have existed for more than a millennium, and had supported ancient agricultural kingdoms. The growing human population has put severe pressure on Java's wildlife, as rainforests were diminished and confined to highland slopes or isolated peninsulas. Some of Java's endemic species are now critically endangered, with some already extinct; Java used to have [[Javan tiger]]s and [[Javan elephant]]s, but both have been rendered extinct. Today, several national parks exist in Java that protect the remnants of its fragile wildlife, such as [[Ujung Kulon National Park|Ujung Kulon]], [[Mount Halimun Salak National Park|Mount Halimun-Salak]], [[Gunung Gede Pangrango National Park|Gede Pangrango]], [[Baluran National Park|Baluran]], [[Meru Betiri National Park|Meru Betiri]] and [[Alas Purwo National Park|Alas Purwo]].

==Administrative division==
The island as well as nearby islands are administratively jointly, divided into four [[Provinces of Indonesia|provinces]]:
*[[Banten]], capital: [[Serang]]
*[[West Java]], capital: [[Bandung]]
*[[Central Java]], capital: [[Semarang]]
*[[East Java]], capital: [[Surabaya]]
and two special regions:
*[[Jakarta]]
*[[Yogyakarta (special region)|Yogyakarta]]
and 4 cultural zones:
*Western Java (Banten, West Java, and Jakarta)
*Central Java (Central Java and Yogyakarta)
*East Java excluding Madura Island
* Madura Island

The island's exceptional fertility and rainfall allowed the development of wet-field rice cultivation, which required sophisticated levels of cooperation between villages. Out of these village alliances, small kingdoms developed. The chain of volcanic mountains and associated highlands running the length of Java kept its interior regions and peoples separate and relatively isolated.&lt;ref&gt;Ricklefs (1991), pp. 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt; Before the advent of Islamic states and European colonialism, the rivers provided the main means of communication, although Java's many rivers are mostly short. Only the [[Brantas River|Brantas]] and Sala rivers could provide long-distance communication, and this way their valleys supported the centres of major kingdoms. A system of roads, permanent bridges and toll gates is thought to have been established in Java by at least the mid-17th century. Local powers could disrupt the routes as could the wet season and road use was highly dependent on constant maintenance. Subsequently, communication between Java's population was difficult.&lt;ref&gt;Ricklefs (1991), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hindu-Buddhist kingdoms era===
The [[Tarumanagara|Taruma]] and [[Sunda kingdom|Sunda]] kingdoms of western Java appeared in the 4th and 7th centuries respectively, while the [[Kalingga Kingdom]] sent embassies to China starting in 640.&lt;ref name=Coedes&gt;{{cite book|last= Coedès|first= George|authorlink= George Coedès|editor= Walter F. Vella|others= trans.Susan Brown Cowing|title= The Indianized States of Southeast Asia|year= 1968|publisher= University of Hawaii Press|isbn= 978-0-8248-0368-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|53,79}} However, the first major principality was the [[Medang Kingdom]] that was founded in central Java at the beginning of the 8th century. Medang's religion centred on the Hindu god [[Shiva]], and the kingdom produced some of Java's earliest Hindu temples on the [[Dieng Plateau]]. Around the 8th century the [[Sailendra]] dynasty rose in [[Kedu Plain]] and become the patron of [[Mahayana]] [[Buddhism]]. This ancient kingdom built monuments such as the 9th century [[Borobudur]] and [[Prambanan]] in central Java.

[[File:Prambanan Trimurti.jpg|thumb| [[Prambanan]] Hindu temple]]
[[File:Borobudur-Temple-Park Indonesia Stupas-of-Borobudur-04.jpg|thumb|The 9th century [[Borobudur]] Buddhist [[stupa]] in Central Java]]
Around the 10th century the centre of power shifted from central to eastern Java. The eastern Javanese kingdoms of [[Kediri (historical kingdom)|Kediri]], [[Singhasari]] and [[Majapahit]] were mainly dependent on rice agriculture, yet also pursued trade within the Indonesian archipelago, and with China and India.

[[Majapahit]] was established by [[Raden Wijaya|Wijaya]]&lt;ref name=Coedes/&gt;{{rp|201}} and by the end of the reign of [[Hayam Wuruk]] (r. 1350–89) it claimed sovereignty over the entire Indonesian archipelago, although control was likely limited to Java, Bali and Madura. Hayam Wuruk's prime minister, [[Gajah Mada]], led many of the kingdom's territorial conquests.&lt;ref name=Coedes/&gt;{{rp|234}} Previous Javanese kingdoms had their power based in agriculture, however, Majapahit took control of ports and shipping lanes and became Java's first commercial empire. With the death of Hayam Wuruk and the [[The spread of Islam in Indonesia|coming of Islam to Indonesia]], Majapahit went into decline.&lt;ref name=Coedes/&gt;{{rp|241}}

===Spread of Islam and rise of Islamic sultanates===
[[Islam]] became the dominant religion in Java at the end of the 16th century. During this era, the Islamic kingdoms of [[Demak Sultanate|Demak]], [[Sultanate of Cirebon|Cirebon]], and [[Banten Sultanate|Banten]] were ascendant. The [[Mataram Sultanate]] became the dominant power of central and eastern Java at the end of the 16th century. The principalities of Surabaya and Cirebon were eventually subjugated such that only Mataram and Banten were left to face the Dutch in the 17th century.

===Colonial periods===
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Thee-kweekbedden zonder afdak Java TMnr 10011931.jpg|thumb|Tea plantation in Java during [[Dutch East Indies|Dutch colonial period]], in or before 1926]]

Java's contact with the European colonial powers began in 1522 with [[Luso Sundanese Treaty|a treaty]] between the [[Sunda kingdom]] and the [[Portuguese Malacca|Portuguese in Malacca]]. After its failure the [[The Portuguese in Indonesia|Portuguese presence]] was confined to Malacca, and to the eastern islands.
In 1596, a four-ship expedition led by [[Cornelis de Houtman]] was the first Dutch contact with Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Globe Encompassed: The Age of European Discovery, 1500–1700|author=Ames, Glenn J.|year=2008|page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 18th century the Dutch had extended their influence over the sultanates of the interior through the [[Dutch East India Company in Indonesia]]. Internal conflict prevented the Javanese from forming effective alliances against the Dutch. Remnants of the Mataram survived as the Surakarta (Solo) and Yogyakarta principalities. Javanese kings claimed to rule with divine authority and the Dutch helped them to preserve remnants of a Javanese aristocracy by confirming them as regents or district officials within the colonial administration.

Java's major role during the early part of the colonial period was as a producer of [[rice]]. In spice producing islands like [[Banda Islands|Banda]], rice was regularly imported from Java, to supply the deficiency in means of subsistence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=St. John|first=Horace Stebbing Roscoe|title=The Indian Archipelago: its history and present state, Volume 1|publisher=Longman, Brown, Green, and Longmans|year=1853 |page=137|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UJ9FAAAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Napoleonic wars]] in Europe, the [[Netherlands]] fell to [[France]], as did its colony in the [[East Indies]]. During the short-lived [[Daendels]] administration, as French proxy rule on Java, the construction of the [[Great Post Road|Java Great Post Road]] was commenced in 1808. The road, spanning from [[Anyer]] in Western Java to Panarukan in East Java, served as a military supply route and was used in defending Java from British invasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ekspedisi Anjer-Panaroekan, Laporan Jurnalistik Kompas|publisher=Pnerbit Buku Kompas, PT Kompas Media Nusantara, Jakarta Indonesia|date=November 2008|pages=1–2|ISBN=978-979-709-391-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1811, Java was [[Invasion of Java (1811)|captured by the British]], becoming a possession of the [[British Empire]], and Sir [[Stamford Raffles]] was appointed as the island's Governor. In 1814, Java was returned to the Dutch under the terms of the [[Treaty of Paris (1814)|Treaty of Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Atkins|first=James|title=The Coins And Tokens Of The Possessions And Colonies Of The British Empire|year=1889&lt;!--|location=Quaritch, Bernard--&gt;|location=London|page=213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1815, there may have been five million people in Java.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/301673/Java Java (island, Indonesia)]. Encyclopædia Britannica.&lt;/ref&gt; In the second half of the 18th century, population spurts began in districts along the north-central coast of Java, and in the 19th century population grew rapidly across the island. Factors for the great population growth include the impact of Dutch colonial rule including the imposed end to civil war in Java, the increase in the area under rice cultivation, and the introduction of food plants such as [[casava]] and [[maize]] that could sustain populations that could not afford rice.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (2003), p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt; Others attribute the growth to the taxation burdens and increased expansion of employment under the [[Cultivation System]] to which couples responded by having more children in the hope of increasing their families' ability to pay tax and buy goods.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (2003), pp. 253–254.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cholera]] claimed 100,000 lives in Java in 1820.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Joseph Patrick|last=Byrne|title=Encyclopedia of Pestilence, Pandemics, and Plagues: A-M|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5Pvi-ksuKFIC&amp;pg=PA99&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2008|page=99|isbn=0-313-34102-8}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The advent of trucks and railways where there had previously only been buffalo and carts, telegraph systems, and more coordinated distribution systems under the colonial government all contributed to famine elimination in Java, and in turn, population growth. There were no significant famines in Java from the 1840s through to the [[Japanese occupation of Indonesia|Japanese occupation]] in the 1940s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor 2003, p. 254&quot;&gt;Taylor (2003), p. 254.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the age of first marriage dropped during the 19th century thus increasing a woman's child bearing years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor 2003, p. 254&quot;/&gt;

===Independence===
{{main|Indonesian National Awakening}}

Indonesian nationalism first took hold in Java in the early 20th century, and [[Indonesian National Revolution|the struggle to secure the country's independence]] following [[World War II]] was centered in Java. In 1949, Indonesia became independent and the island has dominated Indonesian social, political and economic life, which has been the source of resentment of those residents in other islands.

Java has been traditionally demographically dominated by an elite class, while the masses remained agriculturally and fishing bound and thus were sustained by high birthrates.  This elite class has changed over the course of history, as cultural waves after waves lapped the island. There is evidence that South Asian emigres were among this elite, as well as Arabian and Persian immigrants during the Islamic eras.  More recently, Chinese have become part of the economic elite of Java, although politically they generally remain sidelined, there are notable exceptions such as the governor of Jakarta, [[Basuki Tjahaja Purnama]]. Today, Java is increasingly urban, modern culture has arrived in Java, yet only 75% of the island is electrified, villages and their rice paddies still are a common sight, as well as well as a youthful population. Central Java unlike the rest of the island registers very slow population growth, yet it maintains a more youthful population than the national average,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bkkbn.go.id/kependudukan/Pages/DataSensus/Sensus_Penduduk/Pola_Perkawinan/Rata_Usia_Kawin_Pertama/Nasional.aspx Usia Kawin Pertama Rata-Rata Wanita  Menurut Provinsi: Sensus Penduduk Tahun 1990, 2000 dan 2010].

===Population development===
With a combined population of 145 million in the 2015 census (including Madura's 3.7 million),&lt;ref name=JKTPOS&gt;{{cite news|title=Population growth 'good for Papua'|date=23 August 2010|accessdate=30 August 2010|url= http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/08/23/population-growth-%E2%80%98good-papua%E2%80%99.html|work=[[The Jakarta Post]]|archivedate=24 August 2010|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20100824053746/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/08/23/population-growth-%E2%80%98good-papua%E2%80%99.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is estimated for 2014 at 143.1 million (including 3.7 million for Madura), Java is the [[List of islands by population|most populous island in the world]] and is home to 57% of Indonesia's population.&lt;ref name=&quot;JKTPOS&quot;/&gt; At over 1,100 people per km² in 2014, it is also one of the most densely populated parts of the world, on par with Bangladesh. Every region of the island has numerous volcanoes, with the people left to share the remaining flatter land. Because of this, many coasts are heavily populated and cities ring around the valleys surrounding volcanic peaks. Thus the [[physiological density]] of Java is exceptionally high, even by Asian standards.{{or|date=October 2015}}

Notably, population growth rate more than doubled in economically depressed Central Java in the latest 2010-2015 period vs 2000-2010, indicative of migration or other issues, there were significant [[Mount Merapi#2006 eruption|volcanic eruption]]s during the earlier period.  Approximately 45% of the population of Indonesia is ethnically Javanese,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/id.html CIA factbook]&lt;/ref&gt; while Sundanese make a large portion of Java's population as well.

The western third of the island (West Java, Banten, and DKI Jakarta) has an even higher population density, of nearly 1,500 per square kilometer and accounts for the lion's share of the population growth of Java.&lt;ref name=&quot;JKTPOS&quot;/&gt; It is home to three metropolitan areas, [[Greater Jakarta]] (with outlying areas of Greater [[Serang]] and Greater [[Sukabumi]]), [[Bandung Metropolitan Area|Greater Bandung]], and Greater [[Cirebon]].

From the 1970s to the fall of the [[Suharto]] regime in 1998, the Indonesian government ran [[transmigration program]]s aimed at resettling the population of Java on other less-populated islands of Indonesia. This program has met with mixed results, sometimes causing conflicts between the locals and the recently arrived [[settler]]s. Nevertheless, it has caused Java's share of the nation's population to progressively decline.

Jakarta and its outskirts, being the dominant metropolis, is also home to people from all over the nation. East Java is also home to ethnic Balinese, as well as large numbers of Madurans due to their historic poverty.

===Ethnicity and culture===

[[File:Gamelandegung.jpg|thumb|[[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] [[Gamelan]] players]]
Despite its large population and in contrast to the other larger islands of Indonesia, Java is comparatively homogeneous in ethnic composition. Only two ethnic groups are native to the island—the [[Javanese people|Javanese]] and [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]]. A third group is the [[Madurese people|Madurese]], who inhabit the island of [[Madura Island|Madura]] off the north east coast of Java, and have immigrated to [[East Java]] in large numbers since the 18th century.&lt;ref name=Periplus58&gt;{{cite book|last=Hefner|first=Robert|title=Java|publisher=Periplus Editions|year=1997|location=Singapore|page=58|isbn=962-593-244-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Javanese comprise about two-thirds of the island's population, while the Sundanese and Madurese account for 20% and 10% respectively.&lt;ref name=Periplus58/&gt; The fourth group is the [[Betawi people]] that speak a dialect of [[Malay language|Malay]], they are the descendants of the people living around [[Jakarta|Batavia]] from around the 17th century. Betawis are [[creole people]], mostly descended from various Indonesian archipelago ethnic groups such as [[Ethnic Malay|Malay]], [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]], [[Javanese people|Javanese]], [[Balinese people|Balinese]], [[Minangkabau people|Minang]], [[Bugis people|Bugis]], [[Makassar people|Makassar]], [[Ambonese]], mixed with foreign ethnic groups such as [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]], [[Dutch people|Dutch]], [[Arab]], [[Chinese people|Chinese]] and [[Indian peoples|Indian]] brought to or attracted to Batavia to meet labour needs. They have a culture and language distinct from the surrounding [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] and [[Javanese people|Javanese]].

The Javanese [[kakawin]] [[Tantu Pagelaran]] explained the mythical origin of the island and its volcanic nature. Four major cultural areas exist on the island: the ''[[Javanese beliefs|kejawen]]'' or Javanese heartland, the north coast of the ''pasisir'' region, the [[Sundanese people|Sunda]] lands of West Java, and the eastern salient, also known as [[Banyuwangi|Blambangan]]. Madura makes up a fifth area having close cultural ties with coastal Java.&lt;ref name=Periplus58/&gt; The ''kejawen'' Javanese culture is the island's most dominant. Java's remaining aristocracy are based here, and it is the region from where the majority of Indonesia's army, business, and political elite originate. Its language, arts, and etiquette are regarded as the island's most refined and exemplary.&lt;ref name=Periplus58/&gt; The territory from [[Banyumas Regency|Banyumas]] in the west through to [[Blitar]] in the east and encompasses Indonesia's most fertile and densely populated agricultural land.&lt;ref name=Periplus58/&gt;

In the southwestern part of Central Java, which is usually named the [[Banyumas Regency|Banyumasan]] region, a cultural mingling occurred; bringing together Javanese culture and Sundanese culture to create the [[Banyumasan language|Banyumasan]] culture.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} In the central Javanese court cities of [[Yogyakarta (city)|Yogyakarta]] and [[Surakarta]], contemporary kings trace their lineages back to the pre-colonial Islamic kingdoms that ruled the region, making those places especially strong repositories of classical Javanese culture. Classic arts of Java include [[gamelan]] music and [[wayang]] puppet shows.

Java was the site of many influential kingdoms in the Southeast Asian region,&lt;ref&gt;See Wallace Stevens's poem &quot;[[Tea (poem)|Tea]]&quot; for an appreciative allusion to Javanese culture.&lt;/ref&gt; and as a result, many literary works have been written by Javanese authors. These include ''[[Ken Arok]] and [[Ken Dedes]]'', the story of the orphan who usurped his king, and married the queen of the ancient Javanese kingdom; and translations of ''[[Ramayana]]'' and ''[[Mahabharata]]''. [[Pramoedya Ananta Toer]] is a famous contemporary Indonesian author, who has written many stories based on his own experiences of having grown up in Java, and takes many elements from Javanese folklore and historical legends.

===Languages===
[[File:Java languages.JPG|thumb|220px|Languages spoken in Java (Javanese is shown in white). &quot;Malay&quot; refers to [[Betawi language|Betawi]], the local dialect as one of Malay creole dialect.]]

The three major languages spoken on Java are [[Javanese language|Javanese]], [[Sundanese language|Sundanese]] and [[Madurese language|Madurese]]. Other languages spoken include [[Betawi language|Betawi]] (a [[Malay language|Malay]] dialect local to the Jakarta region), [[Osing language|Osing]], [[Banyumasan language|Banyumasan]], and [[Tenggerese]] (closely related to Javanese), [[Baduy]] (closely related to Sundanese), [[Kangean language|Kangean]]ese (closely related to Madurese), and [[Balinese language|Balinese]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=Indonesia+(Java+and+Bali) Languages of Java and Bali] – Ethnologue. Other sources may list some of these as dialects rather than languages.&lt;/ref&gt; The vast majority of the population also speaks [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], often as a second language.

===Religion===

{{main|Religion in Indonesia}}

Java has been a melting pot of religions and cultures, which has created a broad range of religious belief.

[[South Asia|Indian]] influences came first with [[Shaivism]] and [[Buddhism]] penetrating deeply into society, blending with indigenous tradition and culture.&lt;ref name=&quot;kroef1961&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|first=Justus M.|last=van der Kroef|title=New Religious Sects in Java|journal=Far Eastern Survey|volume=30|issue=2|year=1961|pages=18–15|doi=10.1525/as.1961.30.2.01p1432u|jstor=3024260}}&lt;/ref&gt; One [[Conduit (spiritualism)|conduit]] for this were the [[asceticism|ascetic]]s, called ''resi'', who taught mystical practices. A ''resi'' lived surrounded by students, who took care of their master's daily needs. Resi's authorities were merely ceremonial. At the courts, [[Brahmin]] clerics and ''pudjangga'' (sacred literati) legitimised rulers and linked [[Hinduism|Hindu]] cosmology to their political needs.&lt;ref name=&quot;kroef1961&quot;/&gt; Small [[Hindu]] enclaves are scattered throughout Java, but there is a large [[Hindu]] population along the eastern coast nearest [[Bali]], especially around the town of [[Banyuwangi]].

[[Islam]], which came after Hinduism, strengthened the status structure of this traditional religious pattern. More than 90 percent of the people of Java are Muslims, on a broad continuum between ''[[abangan]]'' (more traditional) and ''[[santri]]'' (more modernist). The Muslim scholar of the writ (''[[Kyai]]'') became the new religious elite as Hindu influences receded. Islam recognises no hierarchy of religious leaders nor a formal [[Clergy|priesthood]], but the [[Dutch East India Company|Dutch colonial government]] established an elaborate rank order for mosque and other Islamic preaching schools. In Javanese ''[[pesantren]]'' (Islamic schools), The ''Kyai'' perpetuated the tradition of the ''resi''. Students around him provided his needs, even [[peasant]]s around the school.&lt;ref name=&quot;kroef1961&quot;/&gt;

Pre-Islamic Javan traditions have encouraged Islam in a mystical direction. There emerged in Java a loosely structured society of religious leadership, revolving around ''kyais'', possessing various degrees of proficiency in pre-Islamic and Islamic [[Folklore|lore]], [[belief]] and practice.&lt;ref name=&quot;kroef1961&quot;/&gt; The kyais are the principal intermediaries between the villages masses and the realm of the [[supernatural]]. However, this very looseneess of kyai leadership structure has promoted [[schism (religion)|schism]]. There were often sharp divisions between orthodox kyais, who merely instructed in Islamic law, with those who taught [[mysticism]] and those who sought reformed Islam with modern scientific concepts. As a result, there is a division between ''santri'', who believe that they are more orthodox in their Islamic belief and practice, with ''[[abangan]]'', who have mixed pre-Islamic [[animism|animistic]] and Hindu-Indian concepts with a superficial acceptance of Islamic belief.&lt;ref name=&quot;kroef1961&quot;/&gt;

There are also [[Christian]] communities, mostly in the larger cities, though some rural areas of south-central Java are strongly [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]]. [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] communities also exist in the major cities, primarily among the [[Chinese Indonesian]]. The Indonesian constitution recognises six official religions.

A wider effect of this division is the number of sects. In the middle of 1956, the Department of Religious Affairs in [[Yogyakarta]] reported 63 religious sects in Java other than the official Indonesian religions. Of these, 35 were in [[Central Java]], 22 in [[West Java]] and six in [[East Java]].&lt;ref name=&quot;kroef1961&quot;/&gt; These include [[Javanese beliefs|Kejawen]], [[Javanese beliefs|Sumarah]], [[Subud]], etc. Their total membership is difficult to estimate as many of their adherents identify themselves with one of the official religions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beatty&quot;&gt;Beatty, Andrew, ''Varieties of Javanese Religion: An Anthropological Account'', Cambridge University Press 1999, ISBN 0-521-62473-8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
[[File:KerbauJawa.jpg|left|thumb|[[Water buffalo|Water Buffalo]] ploughing [[Paddy field|rice fields]] near [[Salatiga]], [[Central Java]]]]
Initially the economy of Java relied heavily on [[rice]] agriculture. Ancient kingdoms such as the [[Tarumanagara]], [[Mataram Kingdom|Mataram]], and [[Majapahit]] were dependent on rice yields and tax. Java was famous for rice surpluses and rice export since ancient times, and rice agriculture contributed to the population growth of the island. Trade with other parts of Asia such as India and China flourished as early as the 4th century, as evidenced by Chinese ceramics found on the island dated to that period. Java also took part in the global trade of [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]] [[spice]] from ancient times in the Majapahit era, until well into the [[Dutch East India Company|VOC]] era.

[[Dutch East India Company]] set their foothold on [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] in the 17th century and was succeeded by [[Netherlands East Indies]] in the 19th century. During these colonial times, the Dutch introduced the cultivation of commercial plants in Java, such as [[sugarcane]], [[rubber]], [[coffee]], [[tea]], and [[quinine]]. In the 19th and early 20th century, Javanese coffee gained global popularity. Thus, the name &quot;Java&quot; today has become a synonym for coffee.

[[File:Java Transportation Network.svg|thumb|right|250px|Java transportation network]]
[[File:Jakarta Car Free Day.jpg|thumb|Central [[Jakarta]]]]
Java is the most developed island in Indonesia since the era of Netherlands East Indies to modern Republic of Indonesia. The road transportation networks that have existed since ancient times were connected and perfected with the construction of [[Great Post Road|Java Great Post Road]] by [[Daendels]] in the early 19th century. The Java Great Post Road become the backbone of Java's road infrastructure and laid the base of [[North Coast Road (Java)|Java North Coast Road]] ({{lang-id|Jalan Pantura, abbreviation from &quot;Pantai Utara&quot;}}). The need to transport commercial produces such as coffee from plantations in the interior of the island to the harbour on the coast spurred the construction of railway networks in Java. Today the [[industry]], business and trade, also services flourished in major cities of Java, such as [[Jakarta]], [[Surabaya]], [[Semarang]], and [[Bandung]]; while some traditional Sultanate cities such as [[Yogyakarta]], [[Surakarta]], and [[Cirebon]] preserved its royal legacy and become the centre of art, culture and tourism in Java. Industrial estates also growing in towns on northern coast of Java, especially around [[Cilegon]], [[Tangerang]], [[Bekasi]], [[Karawang]], [[Gresik]] and [[Sidoarjo]]. The [[toll road]] highway networks was built and expanded since [[Suharto]] era until now, connecting major urban centres and surrounding areas, such as in and around [[Jakarta]] and [[Bandung]]; also the ones in [[Cirebon]], [[Semarang]] and [[Surabaya]]. In addition to these motorways, Java has 16 national highways.
