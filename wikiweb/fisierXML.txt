It has an area of {{convert|238391|km2|sqmi}} and a [[temperate climate|temperate]]-[[continental climate]]. With 19.94 million inhabitants, the country is the [[List of European Union member states by population|seventh most populous]] member state of the [[European Union]].

The [[Danube|River Danube]], Europe's second longest river, rises in Germany and flows southeastwards for a distance of 2,857&amp;nbsp;km, coursing through ten countries before emptying in Romania's [[Danube Delta]].

Modern Romania emerged within the territories of the ancient [[Roman Empire|Roman]] province of [[Roman Dacia|Dacia]], and was formed in 1859 through a [[United Principalities|personal union]] of the Danubian Principalities of [[Moldavia]] and [[Wallachia]]. The new state, officially named Romania since 1866, gained independence from the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1877. At the end of [[World War I]], [[Transylvania]], [[Bukovina]] and [[Bessarabia]] united with the sovereign [[Kingdom of Romania]]. During [[World War II]], Romania was an ally of [[Nazi Germany]] against the [[Soviet Union]], fighting side by side with the Wehrmacht until 1944, when it then joined the Allied powers and faced occupation by the [[Red Army]] forces. Romania lost several territories, of which [[Northern Transylvania]] was regained after the war. Following the war, Romania became a [[Socialist state|socialist republic]] and member of the [[Warsaw Pact]]. After the [[Romanian Revolution|1989 Revolution]], Romania [[History of Romania since 1989|began a transition back towards]] democracy and a capitalist [[market economy]].

Following rapid economic growth in the early 2000s, Romania has an economy predominantly based on services, and is a producer and net exporter of machines and electric energy, featuring companies like [[Automobile Dacia]] and [[Petrom|OMV Petrom]]. It has been a member of [[NATO]] since 2004, and part of the [[European Union]] since 2007. A strong majority of the population identify themselves as [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox Christians]] and are native speakers of [[Romanian language|Romanian]], a [[Romance languages|Romance language]]. With a rich [[culture of Romania|cultural history]], Romania has been the home of influential [[Art of Romania|artists]], [[Music of Romania|musicians]], [[Science and technology in Romania|inventors]] and [[Sport in Romania|sportspeople]], and features a variety of [[tourism in Romania|tourist attractions]].

==Etymology==&lt;!--linked--&gt;
{{main article|Name of Romania}}
''Romania''  derives from the Latin ''romanus'', meaning [[Ancient Rome|&quot;citizen of Rome&quot;]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dexonline.ro/search.php?cuv=rom%C3%A2n |title=Explanatory Dictionary of the Romanian Language, 1998; New Explanatory Dictionary of the Romanian Language, 2002 |publisher=Dexonline.ro |accessdate=25 September 2010|language=ro}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first known use of the appellation was attested in the 16th-century by [[Italians|Italian]] humanists travelling in [[Transylvania]], [[Moldavia]], and [[Wallachia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|quote=&quot;nunc se Romanos vocant&quot;|first=Andréas|last=Verres|title=Acta et Epistolae|volume=I|page=243}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|quote=&quot;...si dimandano in lingua loro Romei...se alcuno dimanda se sano parlare in la lingua valacca, dicono a questo in questo modo: Sti Rominest ?

[[File:Neacşu's letter.jpg|thumb|left|[[Neacșu's letter]] from 1521, the oldest surviving document written in [[Romanian language|Romanian]].]]
The oldest surviving document written in [[Romanian language|Romanian]], a 1521 letter known as the &quot;[[Neacșu's letter|Letter of Neacșu from Câmpulung]]&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Ion Rotaru, ''Literatura română veche'', [http://www.cimec.ro/istorie/neacsu/eng/people.htm &quot;The Letter of Neacșu from Câmpulung&quot;], București, 1981, pp. 62–65&lt;/ref&gt; is also notable for including the first documented occurrence of the country's name: Wallachia is mentioned as ''Țeara Rumânească'' (old spelling for &quot;The Romanian Land&quot;; ''țeara'' from the [[Latin]] ''terra'', &quot;land&quot;; current spelling: ''Țara Românească'').

Two spelling forms: ''român'' and ''rumân'' were used interchangeably &lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;''&quot;am scris aceste sfente cărți de învățături, să fie popilor rumânesti... să înțeleagă toți oamenii cine-s rumâni creștini&quot;'' &quot;Întrebare creștinească&quot; (1559), Bibliografia românească veche, IV, 1944, p. 6. &lt;br/&gt;''&quot;...că văzum cum toate limbile au și înfluresc întru cuvintele slăvite a lui Dumnezeu numai noi românii pre limbă nu avem. Pentru aceia cu mare muncă scoasem de limba jidovească si grecească si srâbească pre limba românească 5 cărți ale lui Moisi prorocul si patru cărți și le dăruim voo frați rumâni și le-au scris în cheltuială multă... și le-au dăruit voo fraților români,... și le-au scris voo fraților români&quot;'' Palia de la Orăștie (1581–1582), București, 1968. &lt;br/&gt;''În Țara Ardealului nu lăcuiesc numai unguri, ce și sași peste seamă de mulți și români peste tot locul...'', Grigore Ureche, Letopisețul Țării Moldovei, p. 133–134.&lt;/ref&gt; until sociolinguistic developments in the late 17th century led to semantic differentiation of the two forms: ''rumân'' came to mean  &quot;[[indentured servant|bondsman]]&quot;, while ''român'' retained the original ethnolinguistic meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last = Brezeanu|first = Stelian|title =Romanitatea Orientală în Evul Mediu|publisher =Editura All Educational|year=1999|location =Bucharest|pages =229–246 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the abolition of [[serfdom]] in 1746, the word ''rumân'' gradually fell out of use and the spelling stabilised to the form ''român''.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;In his well known literary testament [[Ienăchiță Văcărescu]] writes: &quot;Urmașilor mei Văcărești!/Las vouă moștenire:/Creșterea limbei românești/Ș-a patriei cinstire.&quot; &lt;br/&gt;In the ''&quot;Istoria faptelor lui Mavroghene-Vodă și a răzmeriței din timpul lui pe la 1790&quot;'' a Pitar Hristache writes: &quot;Încep după-a mea ideie/Cu vreo câteva condeie/Povestea mavroghenească/Dela Țara Românească.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tudor Vladimirescu]], a revolutionary leader of the early 19th century, used the term ''Rumânia'' to refer exclusively to the principality of Wallachia.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Goina, Călin. ''[http://epa.oszk.hu/00400/00476/00005/pdf/13.pdf How the State Shaped the Nation: an Essay on the Making of the Romanian Nation]'' in ''Regio – Minorities, Politics, Society''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of the name ''Romania'' to refer to the common homeland of all Romanians—its modern-day meaning—was first documented in the early 19th century.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;In 1816, the Greek scholar [[Dimitrie Daniel Philippide]] published in [[Leipzig]] his work ''The History of Romania'', followed by ''The Geography of Romania''. &lt;br/&gt;On the [[Headstone|tombstone]] of [[Gheorghe Lazăr]] in [[Avrig]] (built in 1823) there is the inscription: &quot;Precum Hristos pe Lazăr din morți a înviat/Așa tu România din somn ai deșteptat.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The name has been officially in use since 11 December 1861.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fotw.net/flags/ro-wm.html|title=Wallachia and Moldavia, 1859–61|accessdate=5 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In English, the name of the country was formerly spelt ''Rumania'' or ''Roumania'', corresponding to the now obsolete Romanian spelling ''Rumânia''.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, &quot;[http://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/21/opinion/rumania-remarkable-common-ground.html Rumania: Remarkable Common Ground&quot;], ''The New York Times'' (December 21, 1989).&lt;/ref&gt; ''Romania'' became the predominant spelling around 1975.&lt;ref&gt;See the [https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=Romania%2CRumania%2CRoumania&amp;year_start=1870&amp;year_end=2008&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3 Google Ngrams for Romania, Rumania, and Roumania].&lt;/ref&gt; ''Romania'' is also the official English-language spelling used by the Romanian government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdep.ro/pls/dic/site.page?den=act2_2&amp;par1=1#t1c0s0a1|title=General principles|publisher=cdep.ro|language=Romanian|accessdate=7 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other languages, however, continue to prefer forms with ''u'', e.g. French ''Roumanie'', German ''Rumänien'', Polish ''Rumunia'', and Russian Румыния (''Rumyniya'').

In August 1944, a [[coup d'état]] led by [[Michael I of Romania|King Michael]] toppled [[Ion Antonescu]] and his regime. He was convicted of war crimes and executed on 1 June 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/Ion-Antonescu|title=Ion Antonescu {{!}} ruler of Romania|access-date=2016-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; 9 October is now the [[Holocaust Memorial Days|National Day of Commemorating the Holocaust]] in Romania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.holocaustremembrance.com/member-countries/holocaust-education-remembrance-and-research-romania|title=Holocaust Education, Remembrance, and Research in Romania|publisher=holocaustremembrance.com|accessdate=4 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period the regime launched several campaigns of purges in which numerous &quot;[[enemies of the state]]&quot; and &quot;parasite elements&quot; were targeted for different forms of punishment, such as deportation, internal exile and internment in forced labour camps and prisons, sometimes for life, as well as extrajudicial killing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Cicerone|last=Ionițoiu|title=Victimele terorii comuniste.

[[File:Ceausescu Anul Nou.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Nicolae Ceaușescu]] ruled Romania as its Communist leader from 1965 until 1989.]]
[[File:Romanian Revolution 1989 1.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The [[Romanian Revolution]] in 1989 was one of the few violent revolutions in Europe that brought an end to Communist rule (around 4,500 casualties).]]
In 1965, [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]] came to power and started to conduct the foreign policy more independently from the Soviet Union. Thus, Communist Romania was the only [[Warsaw Pact]] country who refused to participate at the Soviet-led [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|1968 invasion]] of [[Czechoslovakia]] (Ceaușescu even publicly condemned the action as &quot;a big mistake, [and] a serious danger to peace in Europe and to the fate of Communism in the world&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|language=Romanian|url=http://www.britishpathe.com/video/political-tension/query/nicolae|title=Political Tension 1968|publisher=British Pathé|date=21 August 1968|location=Bucharest}}&lt;/ref&gt;); it was also the only Communist state to maintain diplomatic relations with [[Israel]] after 1967's [[Six-Day War]]; and established diplomatic relations with [[Federal Republic of Germany|West Germany]] the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/romania/75.htm |publisher=Country Studies.us|title=Romania: Soviet Union and Eastern Europe|accessdate=31 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, close ties with the [[Arab]] countries (and the [[PLO]]) allowed Romania to play a key role in the Israel–[[Egypt]] and Israel–PLO peace talks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://countrystudies.us/romania/80.htm |publisher=Country Studies.us| title=Middle East policies in Communist Romania|accessdate=31 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Romania's foreign debt sharply increased between 1977 and 1981 (from US$3 billion to $10&amp;nbsp;billion),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Deletant |first=Dennis |title=New Evidence on Romania and the Warsaw Pact, 1955–1989 |publisher=Cold War International History Project e-Dossier Series |url=http://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/ACF368.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; the influence of international financial organizations (such as the [[IMF]] and the [[World Bank]]) grew, gradually conflicting with Ceaușescu's [[autocracy|autocratic]] rule. The latter eventually initiated a policy of total reimbursement of the foreign debt by imposing [[1980s austerity policy in Romania|austerity steps]] that impoverished the population and exhausted the economy. The process succeeded in repaying all foreign government debt of Romania in 1989. At the same time, Ceaușescu greatly extended the authority of the Securitate secret police and imposed a severe [[Nicolae Ceaușescu's cult of personality|cult of personality]], which led to a dramatic decrease in the dictator's popularity and culminated in his overthrow and eventual execution, together with his wife, in the violent [[Romanian Revolution]] of December 1989. The charges for which they were executed were, among others, genocide by starvation.

===Democracy===
{{main article|History of Romania since 1989}}
After the revolution, the [[National Salvation Front (Romania)|National Salvation Front]] (NSF), led by [[Ion Iliescu]], took partial multi-party democratic and free market measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Carothers |first=Thomas |title=Romania: The Political Background |url= http://www.idea.int/publications/country/upload/Romania,%20The%20Political%20Background.pdf |format=PDF |quote=&quot;This seven-year period can be characterized as a gradualistic, often ambiguous transition away from communist rule towards democracy.&quot; |accessdate=31 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Hellman |first=Joel |title=Winners Take All: The Politics of Partial Reform in Postcommunist |journal=Transitions World Politics |volume=50 |issue=2 |date=January 1998 |pages=203–234}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1990, a sit-in protest contesting the results of the elections and accusing the NSF, including Iliescu, of being made up of former Communists and members of the Securitate &amp;mdash; rapidly grew to become what was called the [[Golaniad]]. The peaceful demonstrations degenerated into violence, prompting the intervention of coal miners summoned by Iliescu. This episode has been documented widely by both local&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mineriade.iiccr.ro/vocile_presei/presa_interna/ |title=Institutul de Investigare a Crimelor Comunismului si Memoria Exilului Romanesc |publisher=mineriade.iiccr.ro |accessdate=14 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and foreign media,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mineriade.iiccr.ro/vocile_presei/presa_internationala/ |title=Institutul de Investigare a Crimelor Comunismului si Memoria Exilului Romanesc |publisher=mineriade.iiccr.ro |accessdate=14 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is remembered as the [[June 1990 Mineriad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Bohlen |first=Celestine |title=Evolution in Europe; Romanian miners invade Bucharest |url= http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE6D6113DF936A25755C0A966958260 |quote=Responding to an emergency appeal by President Ion Iliescu, thousands of miners from northern Romania descended on the capital city today |accessdate=31 August 2008 |work=The New York Times |date=15 June 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mineriade.iiccr.ro/cronologie_evenimente/1990/ |title=Institutul de Investigare a Crimelor Comunismului si Memoria Exilului Romanesc |publisher=mineriade.iiccr.ro |accessdate=14 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The subsequent disintegration of the Front produced several political parties, including the [[Social Democratic Party (Romania)|Social Democratic Party]] and the [[Democratic Party (Romania)|Democratic Party]]. The former governed Romania from 1990 until 1996 through several coalitions and governments with Ion Iliescu as head of state. Since then, there have been several democratic changes of government: in 1996 [[Emil Constantinescu]] was elected president, in 2000 Iliescu returned to power, while [[Traian Băsescu]] was elected in 2004 and was narrowly re-elected in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hotnews.ro/stiri-international-6689374-presa-internationala-despre-alegerile-din-romania-traian-basescu-castigat-limita-romanii-mici-sperante-dezghete-ajutorul-fmi.htm Presa internationala despre alegerile din Romania: Traian Basescu a castigat la limita; Romanii au mici sperante sa se dezghete ajutorul de la FMI – International].

Following the experience of economic instability throughout the 1990s, and the implementation of a free travel agreement with the EU, a great number of Romanians emigrated to North America and Western Europe, with particularly large communities in Italy and Spain.

The emigration has caused social changes in Romania, whereby the parents would leave for Western Europe to escape poverty and provide a better standard of living for their children, who have been left behind. Some children are left to be taken care of by grandparents and relatives; and some live alone, if the parents deem their kids reasonably self-sufficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Thorpe |first=Nick |title=EU migration: Romania's absent parents |publisher=BBC |date=2014-01-02 |url=http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-25558078 |accessdate=2016-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the youth began to be called [[Euro-orphan]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Schmitt |first=Caroline |title=Mothering via Skype: Europe's absentee parents |publisher=Deutsche Welle |date=2014-11-27 |url=http://www.dw.com/en/mothering-via-skype-europes-absentee-parents/a-18092630 |accessdate=2016-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate===
[[File:Romania map of Köppen climate classification.svg|thumb|right|Romania map of Köppen climate classification.]]
Owing to its distance from open [[sea]] and position on the southeastern portion of the European continent, Romania has a climate that is [[temperate climate|temperate]] and [[continental climate|continental]], with four distinct seasons.

There are some regional differences: in the western parts (such as [[Banat]]), the climate is milder, and has some Mediterranean influences; while the eastern part of the country has a more pronounced continental climate. In [[Dobruja]], the Black Sea also exerts an influence over the region's climate.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.meteoromania.ro/anm/?page_id=114&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governance==
{{main article|Politics of Romania|Government of Romania}}
The [[Constitution of Romania]] is based on the [[Constitution of France|Constitution of France's Fifth Republic]] and was approved in a national referendum on 8 December 1991, and amended in October 2003 to bring it into conformity with the EU legislation. The country is governed on the basis of a multi-party democratic system and the separation of powers between the legislative, executive and judicial branches. It is a [[semi-presidential]] republic where executive functions are held by both [[Government of Romania|government]] and the [[President of Romania|president]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Tony|last=Verheijen |url=http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/oso/public/content/politicalscience/9780198293866/acprof-9780198293866-chapter-10.html |title=Oxford Scholarship Online: Semi-Presidentialism in Europe |publisher=Oxfordscholarship.com |date=14 March 1990 |accessdate=29 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter is elected by popular vote for a maximum of two terms of five years and appoints the prime minister, who in turn appoints the [[Romanian Cabinet|Council of Ministers]]. The legislative branch of the government, collectively known as the [[Parliament of Romania|Parliament]] (residing at the [[Palace of the Parliament]]), consists of [[Bicameralism|two chambers]] ([[Senate of Romania|Senate]] and [[Chamber of Deputies of Romania|Chamber of Deputies]]) whose members are elected every four years by [[Plurality voting system|simple plurality]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Europaworld&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antena3.ro/politica/se-schimba-sistemul-de-vot-deputatii-au-adoptat-noua-lege-electorala-propusa-de-usl-168053.html |title=Se schimbă sistemul de vot. Deputații au adoptat noua Lege Electorală propusă de USL |publisher=Antena3.ro |accessdate=12 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The justice system is independent of the other branches of government, and is made up of a hierarchical system of courts culminating in the [[High Court of Cassation and Justice]], which is the supreme court of Romania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scj.ro/monogr_en.asp|publisher=High Court of Cassation and Justice -—Romania|title=Presentation|accessdate=31 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also courts of appeal, county courts and local courts. The Romanian judicial system is strongly influenced by the [[French law|French model]], considering that it is based on [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] and is [[inquisitorial system|inquisitorial]] in nature. The [[Curtea Constituțională|Constitutional Court]] (''Curtea Constituțională'') is responsible for judging the compliance of laws and other state regulations to the constitution, which is the fundamental law of the country and can only be amended through a public referendum.&lt;ref name=&quot;Europaworld&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://permanent.access.gpo.gov/lps35389/2000//legal_system.html|title=Romanian Legal system|publisher=CIA Factbook|year=2000|accessdate=11 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2007 entry into the EU has been a significant influence on its domestic policy, and including [[judicial reform]]s, increased judicial cooperation with other member states, and measures to combat corruption.

{{main article|Foreign relations of Romania}}
Since December 1989, Romania has pursued a policy of strengthening relations with the West in general, more specifically with the United States and the [[European Union]]. It joined the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO) on 29 March 2004, the European Union (EU) on 1 January 2007, while it had joined the [[International Monetary Fund]] and the [[World Bank]] in 1972, and is a founding member of the [[World Trade Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wto.org/English/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/org6_e.htm |title=Understanding the WTO – members |publisher=WTO |accessdate=29 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current government has stated its goal of strengthening ties with and helping other countries (in particular [[Moldova]], [[Ukraine]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]) with the process of integration with the rest of the West.&lt;ref name=mae&gt;{{cite web|title=Foreign Policy Priorities of Romania for 2008|language=Romanian|url=http://www.mae.ro/index.php?unde=doc&amp;id=35181&amp;idlnk=1&amp;cat=3|publisher=Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs|accessdate=28 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Romania has also made clear since the late 1990s that it supports NATO and EU membership for the democratic former Soviet republics in Eastern Europe and the [[Caucasus]].&lt;ref name=mae/&gt; Romania also declared its public support for [[Turkey]], and [[Croatia]] joining the European Union.&lt;ref name=mae/&gt; Because it has a large Hungarian minority, Romania has also developed [[Hungary–Romania relations|strong relations]] with [[Hungary]]. Romania opted on 1 January 2007, to adhere the [[Schengen Area]], and its bid to join was approved by the [[European Parliament]] in June 2011, but was rejected by the [[Council of the European Union|EU Council]] in September 2011.

In December 2005, President [[Traian Băsescu]] and [[United States Secretary of State]] [[Condoleezza Rice]] signed an agreement that would allow a U.S. military presence at several Romanian facilities primarily in the eastern part of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/35722.htm|publisher=U.S. Department of State|title=Background Note: Romania – U.S.-Romanian Relations}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2009, [[Hillary Clinton]], US [[Secretary of State]], declared that &quot;Romania is one of the most trustworthy and respectable partners of the USA.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bucharestherald.com/politics/34-politics/3116-hillary-clinton-romania-one-of-the-most-trustworthy-and-respectable-partners-of-the-usa-] {{wayback|url=http://www.bucharestherald.com/politics/34-politics/3116-hillary-clinton-romania-one-of-the-most-trustworthy-and-respectable-partners-of-the-usa- |date=20090512144240 |df=y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Romania is divided into 41 [[Counties of Romania|counties]] (județe, pronounced judets) and the municipality of [[Bucharest]].

After 1989 the country experienced a decade of economic instability and decline, led in part by an obsolete industrial base and a lack of structural reform.
